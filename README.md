Hello, there! I've started my path to get my Bachelor's Degree this spring. I decided to take notes about every step during this journey. Bellow, it's some explanations about this degree. In each subject folder, I'll put the exercises that I've made and the sample solution for each one. As soon as possible, I'll add a legend to make it easy to get where and what I'll study each season.
