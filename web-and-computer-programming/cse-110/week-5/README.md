#### 💡📆 Tip of Week:

>If you freeze while you tryn' to fix some bugs, you should stop and do something relaxing, sleep and so try again. Last week I tried for hours on end without interruption and I didn't find the solution for my week project. I only found sadness and pain. Breaks are very importants. 😁

#### 💡🤯 What did I learn this week?

>1. I learned a lot about how lists and tuples (lists with more than one collums) work. I discoverd that when want to access a value in a specific position on one of the collums of a tuple, we have to use two or more brackets []. I also learn about the methods isdigit() and isalpha() that respetively identifies if a input value is a number or a string.

---

>2. Some methods that I used to manipulate the list of items I had never heard about. As .pop() to remove, .insert() to add a new item in specified position and .append() to add a new item in the end of the list.
```python	
index_num = int(input("\nWhich item would you like to change? "))
new_purchase = input("What is the new item? ")
itens.pop(index_num)
itens.insert(index_num, new_purchase)
´´´
