#### üí°üìÜ Tip of Week:

>If you freeze while you tryn' to fix some bugs, you should stop and do something relaxing, sleep and so try again. Last week I tried for hours on end without interruption and I didn't find the solution for my week project. I only found sadness and pain. Breaks are very importants. üòÅ

#### üí°ü§Ø What did I learn this week?

>Wow, I learned a lot about how lists and tuples (lists with more than one collums) work. I discoverd that when want to access a value in a specific position on one of the collums of a tuple, we have to use two or more brackets []. I also learn about the methods isdigit() and isalpha() that respetively identifies if a input value is a number or a string.
