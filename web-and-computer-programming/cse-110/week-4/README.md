#### ðŸ’¡ðŸ¤¯ What did I learn this week?

>This week, while I prepared for a team activity and compared my code with the sample solution. I realized how redundant my code was and was amazed that I had used three times more lines than necessary to fulfill the requirements. I learned my lesson and will analyze all possibilities for reducing my code in the future.
