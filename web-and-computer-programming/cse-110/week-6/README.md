Week 06 - Files
</h1>
<b>Middle of Week Exercises:</b>

- [books](/web-and-computer-programming/cse-110/week-6/books.py)
- [people](/web-and-computer-programming/cse-110/week-6/people.py)

#### ðŸ’¡ðŸ“† Tip of Week:

>Learn that after reading a file, cleaning and organizing it, and separating it into distinct lists, you will be able to manipulate it most effectively by converting it into a tuple. As in the example below, taken from this weekâ€™s project:
>parts2 = list(zip(entity, code, year, life_expectancy))

#### ðŸ’¡ðŸ¤¯ What did I learn this week?

>About working with files in Python, I needed to change the usual syntax and use the slash in the address instead of the backslash - default in Windows addresses.
>I learned that in Python we can include an IF statement within the FOR declaration. And all this by assigning the result of this "filter" to a new list.
